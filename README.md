# INTRODUCTION

Our project is about about Air BNB aanalysis.
As quick reminder, Air BNB stands for "Air bed and breakfast" which is a service that lets property owners rent 
out their space to travelers looking or placeto rent stay.

As professional Data Scientists consultant, our job is to analyze Data, and bring some advices to whoever wants to start an Air BNB Business, or to whoever user looking Air BNB rental place.

After this, we will be able to answer somes questions such as:
- what is the total number of Booking in each city per year?
- what is the city with highest booking price per year?
- What is the average number of booking per day?
- How many people are currently using Air BNB service?
- How many property are currently verified and so on...?

To answer all those questions, we have present this work in 2 Parts:

**First Part**: Querying and visualyzation DATA, using SQL and TABLEAU

**2nd Part**: Rental property success predictor using Machine Learning.

Lets get started with the first part,

Part 1: Why SQL?
SQL is the structured query Language used to communicated with DATABASE.
TABLEAU
Wlhile looking for Air BNB, user wants to be sure that the place is secure as possible.
In order to be verified, host need to go through the verification process by providing some personal information.
